# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Python üêç - CO2 Emissions

Now let's now move on to the competition and challenge.



# üìñ Background
You volunteer for a public policy advocacy organization in Canada, and your colleague asked you to help her draft recommendations for guidelines on CO2 emissions rules.

After researching emissions data for a wide range of Canadian vehicles, she would like you to investigate which vehicles produce lower emissions.




# üíæ The data I

You have access to seven years of CO2 emissions data for Canadian vehicles (source):

"Make" - The company that manufactures the vehicle.

"Model" - The vehicle's model.

"Vehicle Class" - Vehicle class by utility, capacity, and weight.

"Engine Size(L)" - The engine's displacement in liters.

"Cylinders" - The number of cylinders.

"Transmission" - The transmission type: A = Automatic, AM = Automatic Manual, AS = Automatic with select shift, AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3 - 10 = the number of gears.

"Fuel Type" - The fuel type: X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol (E85), N = natural gas.

"Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)" - Combined city/highway (55%/45%) fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).

"CO2 Emissions(g/km)" - The tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer for combined city and highway driving.
The data comes from the Government of Canada's open data website.




# üí™ Challenge I

Help your colleague gain insights on the type of vehicles that have lower CO2 emissions. Include:

What is the median engine size in liters?

What is the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?

What is the correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?

Which vehicle class has lower average CO2 emissions, 'SUV - SMALL' or 'MID-SIZE'?

What are the average CO2 emissions for all vehicles? For vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller?

Any other insights you found during your analysis?
